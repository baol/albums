# Albums

A minimalistic TIDAL's favourites album player for Denon HEOS. 

For people that have a Tidal and HEOS account linked together, and some favourite albums to play.

The idea is to reproduce the 1900s experience of listening to albums (either LPs or CDs) by selecting 
them one by one from the collection and playing albums from start to finish.

> ### Note
> When clicking on an Album image the album will replace the current playlist and it will start playing.
>

> ### Note
> The app will play on the first discovered device on the network, please adjust `app.js` if you have multiple devices.
